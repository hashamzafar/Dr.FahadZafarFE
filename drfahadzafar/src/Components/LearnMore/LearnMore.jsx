                <article><h4 className="title my-5">COMMUNICATION</h4>


                    <p className="">It’s important your periodontist is in close communication with your dentist. They will need to work as a team to manage your periodontal condition and ensure long-term care. Dr Fahad has a good relationship with all her referrers and always keeps them up-to-date.</p>
                    <h4 className="title my-5">COMPREHENSIVE CARE</h4>
                    <p className="">Ensure the periodontist is working with a team to ensure your care is comprehensive. Dr Fahad works alongside hygienists and has an after-care team to ensure the condition doesn’t reoccur once treated.</p>

                    <h4 className="title my-5">CONTACTABLE</h4>
                    <p className="">It’s important to pick someone who is easily contactable. Dr Fahad speaks with her patients directly and is available to call at anytime.</p>
                    <h4 className="title my-5">CREDENTIALS</h4>
                    <p className="">Ensure your periodontist has the required credentials. Dr Fahad is a registered periodontal specialist.</p>

                    <h4 className="title my-5">CARING</h4>
                    <p className="">This is especially important for nervous patients. Dr Fahad is well-known for her calming nature and ability to put nervous patients at ease.</p>
                    <h6 className="title my-5">Many people have fears or phobias when it comes to visiting the dentist.</h6>

                    <p className="">          The FZ Perio team treat many anxious patients and can provide the care and support needed so you can receive the treatment you deserve for a healthy smile.
                        What are dental phobias?
                        Dental phobias may cause fear so strong that even the thought of visiting your dentist can cause anxiety.

                        The best way to handle your dental phobia is to face it directly. Making an appointment to discuss your fears is the best place to start. At FZ Perio, we are committed to your dental health and overall well-being and will ensure you are comfortable throughout your treatment.</p>

                    <h6 className="title my-5">How can my dental professional help keep me calm?</h6>
                    <p className="">         We are experienced in handling nervous patients and can work compassionately to alleviate all your stresses.
                        We can discuss your treatment in detail before your appointment and will work at a pace comfortable for you.
                        We also use the Wand® for local anaesthetic, which is a less invasive and precise numbing procedure compared with typical dental injections. It is an ideal solution if you have a fear of needles.
                        If you are overly stressed and nervous, we also do offer sedation. This is conscious sedation that results in little memory of the treatment you have received. You will still be awake during the treatment, just very relaxed and unaware of the procedure being performed.
                        If you suffer from dental phobias, contact the FZ Perio team today on 020 7112 9036 to discuss how we can address your dental fears together.</p>
