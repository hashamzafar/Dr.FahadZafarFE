                Lagos, NigeriaIntroduction: Dental esthetics affects
                how people are perceived by society and how they perceive themselves,
                and this may also affect their oral health–related quality of life (OHRQoL).
                The aim of this study was to comparethe impacts of self-perceived and normatively assessed
                dental esthetics on the OHRQoL of a young adultpopulation.
                Methods: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study involving 375 undergraduate universitystudents,
                aged 18 to 30 years old. Data collection was carried out through oral examinations
                and self-administered questionnaires. Dental esthetics of the students was assessed using the esthetic component
                of the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need. Two OHRQoL instruments were used:
                the shortened version of theOral Health Impact Proﬁle and the Psychosocial Impact of Dental
                Aesthetics Questionnaire. Results: Statisti-cally signiﬁcant relationships (P\0.05) were recorded
                between both self-perceived and normativelyassessed dental esthetics of the students,
                respectively, and 3 of the 4 Psychosocial Impact of DentalAesthetics Questionnaire subscales:
                dental self-conﬁdence (Kruskall-Wallis, P50.000; P50.000),psychological impact (P50.003, P50.047),
                and esthetic concern (P50.006, P50.003). The onlyexception was the social impact subscale, in
                which a signiﬁcant relationship was recorded only with self-perceived dental esthetics (P50.040).
                For the shortened version of the Oral Health Impact Proﬁle scale,
                marked differences were also observed between the impacts recorded for both self-assessments andnormative assessments,
                respectively, particularly for the psychological disability domain (Fisher exact test,P50.021, P50.000; P50.064, P50.096).
                Conclusions: Differences exist between the impacts of self-perceived and normatively assessed dental esthetics on the OHRQoL of young adults,
                particularly in thepsychosocial domains. These differences should be considered in orthodontic treatment planning for youngadult populations.
                (Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop 2016;150:627-36)Facial and dental attractiveness represents impor-tant elements of quality of life for patients
                seekingorthodontic treatment. Most of these patients areoften more concerned with improving their appearanceand social acceptance than
                they are with improving theiroral function or health.1This is reinforced by the factthat research has shown that people may be judged byothers
                based on their dental esthetics; with poor dentalesthetics in children and adults associated with lower in-telligence,
                whereas adults with ideal smiles are consid-ered more intelligent and have a greater chance ofﬁnding a job,
                than do those with nonideal smiles.2,3However, there are considerable differences be-tween a clinician's and a patient's perceptions of
                dentalappearance and needs for orthodontic treatment.4Theclinician often uses traditional methods of measuringdental health and appearance,
                such as the Index ofOrthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN) and the DentalAesthetic Index; these cannot create a living pictureof how people's daily lives are affected by oral healthissues.5,6A
                major limitation of this approach is thatit fails to take into account the way people reallyfeel and therefore does not correspond to broaderconcepts of health and needs.7To overcome this short-coming,
                research has focused on developing broadersociodental concepts of oral health and as a resul
